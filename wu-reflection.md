*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was still somewhat confused with merging and working with branches before this session. I had some understanding of how these concepts worked, but I wanted to be more familiar with them.

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Aside from the concepts that I mentioned above, I was able to learn more about merge conflicts and how to resolve them. I was also able to get more practice working with Git and GitHub.

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked the guide if there was a specific way commit messages should be written. She answered that commit messages should be written in the present tense. I didn't ask my pair any questions related to the pairing session.

*What still confuses you about Git?

I don't think there is anything about Git that really confuses me, but I still think I need more practice with its commands and workings. I want to be able to type git commands from memory.

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I liked the experience, though I felt the session went a little too quickly.
